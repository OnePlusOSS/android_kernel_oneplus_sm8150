BCL Peripheral driver for PMIC5:
===============================================================================
Qualcomm Technologies, Inc's PMIC has battery current limiting peripheral,
which can monitor for high battery current and low battery voltage in the
hardware. The BCL peripheral driver interacts with the PMIC peripheral using
the SPMI driver interface. The hardware can take threshold for notifying for
high battery current or low battery voltage events. This driver works only
with PMIC version 5, where the same BCL peripheral can be found in multiple
PMIC's that are used in a device, with limited functionalities. For example,
one PMIC can have only vbat monitoring, while the other PMIC can have both
vbat and ibat monitoring. This is a common driver, that can interact
with the multiple BCL peripherals.

Required Parameters:
- compatible: must be
	'qcom,bcl-v5' for bcl peripheral in PMIC version 5.
- reg: <a b> where 'a' is the starting register address of the PMIC
	peripheral and 'b' is the size of the peripheral address space.
- interrupts: <a b c d> Where,
		'a' is the SLAVE ID of the PMIC,
		'b' is the peripheral ID,
		'c' is the interrupt number in PMIC and
		'd' is the interrupt type.
- interrupt-names: user defined names for the interrupts. These
		interrupt names will be used by the drivers to identify the
		interrupts, instead of specifying the ID's. bcl driver will
		accept these standard interrupts.
		"bcl-ibat-lvl0",
		"bcl-ibat-lvl1",
		"bcl-vbat-lvl0",
		"bcl-vbat-lvl1",
		"bcl-vbat-lvl2",

Optional Parameters:
- qcom,ibat-use-qg-adc-5a: This optional property is used to divide Ibat
		scaling factor by two for PMIC QG_ADC with ibat range of 5A.
		By default, this Ibat scaling factor will be 1 corresponding
		to FG_ADC with 10A range.

Example:
		bcl@4200 {
			compatible = "qcom,bcl-v5";
			reg = <0x4200 0x100>;
			interrupts = <0x2 0x42 0x0 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>,
					<0x2 0x42 0x1 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
			interrupt-names = "bcl-ibat-lvl0",
						"bcl-vbat-lvl0";
			qcom,ibat-use-qg-adc-5a;
		};
