MSM SuperSpeed USB3.0 SoC controller

Required properties :
- compatible : should be "qcom,dwc-usb3-msm"
 - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
   Required regs are:
	"core_base" : usb controller register set
- interrupts: IRQ lines used by this controller
- interrupt-names : Interrupt resource entries are :
	"pwr_event_irq" : Interrupt to controller for asynchronous events in LPM.
	Used for SS-USB power events.
 - clocks: a list of phandles to the controller clocks. Use as per
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
 - clock-names: Names of the clocks in 1-1 correspondence with the "clocks"
   property. Required clocks are "xo", "iface_clk", "core_clk", "sleep_clk"
   and "utmi_clk".
- resets: reset specifier pair consists of phandle for the reset provider
  and reset lines used by this controller.
- reset-names: reset signal name strings sorted in the same order as the resets
  property.

Optional properties :
- reg: Additional registers
     "ahb2phy_base" : top-level register to configure read/write wait cycle with
     both QMP and QUSB PHY registers.
- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
  below optional properties:
    - qcom,msm_bus,name
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_cases
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_paths
    - qcom,msm_bus,vectors
- qcom,default-bus-vote: To use default bus voting other than NOMINAL. Default is NOMINAL.
- interrupt-names : Optional interrupt resource entries are:
    "ss_phy_irq"  : Interrupt from super speed phy for wake up notification.
    "hs_phy_irq" : Interrupt from HS PHY for asynchronous events in LPM.
    "dp_hs_phy_irq" : Interrupt from HS PHY for asynchronous events in LPM
    going through PDC. (use qcom,use-pdc-interrupts property)
    "dm_hs_phy_irq" : Interrupt from HS PHY for asynchronous events in LPM
    going through PDC. (use qcom,use-pdc-interrupts property)

 - clocks: a list of phandles to the controller clocks. Use as per
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
 - clock-names: Names of the clocks in 1-1 correspondence with the "clocks"
   property. Optional clocks are "bus_aggr_clk", "noc_aggr_clk" and "cfg_ahb_clk".
- qcom,charging-disabled: If present then battery charging using USB
  is disabled.
- vbus_dwc3-supply: phandle to the 5V VBUS supply regulator used for host mode.
- USB3_GDSC-supply : phandle to the globally distributed switch controller
  regulator node to the USB controller.
- dpdm-supply: phandle to dpdm supply which will be used to drive dp/dm lines
  in high-z state.
- qcom,dwc-usb3-msm-tx-fifo-size: If present, represents RAM size available for
		TX fifo allocation in bytes
- qcom,lpm-to-suspend-delay-ms: Indicates timeout (in milliseconds) to release wakeup source
  after USB is kept into LPM.
- qcom,disable-dev-mode-pm: If present, it disables PM runtime functionality for device mode.
- qcom,core-clk-rate: If present, indicates clock frequency to be set for USB master clock.
- qcom,core-clk-rate-hs: If present, indicates min core clock frequency required to support
  hs speed.
- qcom,use-pdc-interrupts: It present, it configures provided PDC IRQ with required
  configuration for wakeup functionality.
- extcon: phandles to external connector devices. First phandle should point to
	  external connector, which provide type-C based "USB" cable events, the
	  second should point to external connector device, which provide type-C
	  "USB-HOST" cable events. A single phandle may be specified if a single
	  connector device provides both "USB" and "USB-HOST" events. An optional
	  third phandle may be specified for EUD based attach/detach events. A
	  mandatory fourth phandle has to be specified to provide microUSB based
	  "USB" cable events. An optional fifth phandle may be specified to provide
	  microUSB based "USB-HOST" cable events. Only the fourth phandle may be
	  specified if a single connector device provides both "USB" and "USB-HOST"
	  events.
- qcom,num-gsi-evt-buffs: If present, specifies number of GSI based hardware accelerated
  event buffers. 1 event buffer is needed per h/w accelerated endpoint.
- qcom,gsi-reg-offset: USB GSI wrapper registers offset. It is must to provide this
  if qcom,num-gsi-evt-buffs property is specified. Check dwc3-msm driver for order
  and name of register offset need to provide.
- qcom,pm-qos-latency: This represents max tolerable CPU latency in microsecs,
	which is used as a vote by driver to get max performance in perf mode.
- qcom,smmu-s1-bypass: If present, configure SMMU to bypass stage 1 translation.
- qcom,dbm-version: If present, specifies DBM version. Currently "1.4" or "1.5"
	are supported. If omitted, assume HW supports "1.5".
- qcom,reset-ep-after-lpm-resume: If present, dbm requires ep reset after
	going to lpm
- qcom,host-poweroff-in-pm-suspend: If present, allow PM suspend to happen
	irrespective of runtimePM state of host and power collapse the core.
	This also leads to reset-resume of connected devices on PM resume.
- qcom,default-mode-none: If present, do not start any mode on probe for an OTG
	capable DWC3 which does not have extcon handle.
- qcom,default-mode-host: If present, start host mode on probe for an OTG
	capable DWC3 which does not have extcon handle.
