MSM MHI DEV

MSM MHI DEV enables communication with the host over a PCIe link using the
Modem Host Interface protocol. The driver interfaces with the IPA for
enabling the HW acceleration channel path and provides interface for
software channels to communicate between Host and device.

Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "qcom,msm-mhi-dev" for MHI device driver.
  - reg: MHI MMIO physical register space.
  - reg-names: resource names used for the MHI MMIO physical address region,
	       IPA uC command and event ring doorbell mail box address.
	       Should be "mhi_mmio_base" for MHI MMIO physical address,
	       "ipa_uc_mbox_crdb" for IPA uC Command Ring doorbell,
	       "ipa_uc_mbox_erdb" for IPA uC Event Ring doorbell passed to
	       the IPA driver.
  - qcom,mhi-ifc-id: ID of HW interface via which MHI on device side
		communicates with host side.
  - qcom,mhi-ep-msi: End point MSI number.
  - qcom,mhi-version: MHI specification version supported by the device.

Optional property:
  - qcom,use-ipa-software-channel: If property is present use IPA hardware
		accelerated path for MHI software channel data transfers
		between host and device.
  - qcom,mhi-config-iatu: If property is present map the control and data region
		between host and device using iatu.
  - qcom,mhi-interrupt: If property is present register for mhi interrupt.
  - qcom,mhi-local-pa-base: The physical base address on the device used by the
		MHI device driver to map the control and data region with the
		MHI driver on the host. This property is required if iatu
		property qcom,mhi-config-iatu is present.

Example:

	mhi: qcom,msm-mhi-dev {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-mhi-dev";
		reg = <0xfc527000 0x1000>,
		     <0xfd4fa000 0x1>,
		     <0xfd4fa080 0x1>;
		reg-names = "mhi_mmio_base", "ipa_uc_mbox_crdb",
			    "ipa_uc_mbox_erdb";
		qcom,mhi-ifc-id = <0x030017cb>;
		qcom,mhi-ep-msi = <1>;
		qcom,mhi-version = <0x1000000>;
	};
